## About
A lot of data is lost due to the hassle of manual documentation and tracking. Keeping track of when
bugs are opened, closed, reopened, and closed again is pure manual labor and not worth the effort.
In the context of a project, though, this data is highly valuable for prediction and optimization
of project timelines and general usage.

Products like Todoist, Google Keep, Google Docs, etc, are great organizing tasks, but tasks can only
ever be "complete" or "not complete", and they don't provide you with good tools for organizing them
apart from single-category slotting. Asking to "make a gantt chart for project x", or "make a
timeline for bug x", or "what have I done in the past 6 months" just isn't possible without a lot of
manual effort.

Stak aims to provide an open-source and free solution to this. See the
[Stak Overview Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwZNR5oGuxlDcLGeZmwZ_WZ5g9kLDsC2Agoefzhfhvc)
for a complete overview of what Stak will become.
